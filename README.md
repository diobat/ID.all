ID.all is a software package developed as a management tool for a platform of communications capable of listening to a backscattering sensor. 

Powered by Python and developed with the Raspberry Pi platform in mind, this script is able to, through an antenna, receive RF ASK modulated signals from the air, demodulate and parse them into network-ready database
entries.

This software makes use of third party libraries such as pyrtlsdr, scipy, and RPi.GPIO.
